# Google-Certification-Case-Study
Case study guided by instructors in Google Data Analytics Certification in Coursera.

## Introduction

This case study served as the final project, showcasing the technical and analytical skills acquired throughout the course. The study's access can be found in this repository's description, and further details are available through the provided link.

The course design centered around the data analysis steps of Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act, with a primary focus on teaching students how to make business decisions based on data. Participants gained an understanding of data structure, as well as the cleaning, sorting, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing of data using various platforms such as spreadsheets (Google Sheets: https://www.google.com/intl/es/sheets/about/), SQL (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox), R language, and Tableau (https://public.tableau.com/app/discover).

### Case Study Description

The scenario presented involved a fictional bike-share company named "Cyclistic." According to Cyclistic's 2016 program, the company has expanded its operations to include a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and secured in a network of 692 stations throughout Chicago.

As a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team, the student's role was to analyze data and provide insights to the company's executive team, who were identified as the primary stakeholders.

### Business Task
Develop marketing strategies that aim to convert casual riders into annual members based on the last three months of customer behaviour data (the study case suggested doing a 12 month analysis, yet the data was too big for the cloud program for running R's RAM: https://posit.cloud/, so it was decided to do a 3 month analysis).

The project seeks to answer the following questions:

- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
- Why would casual riders buy a membership?
- How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Work

### Ask Phase
The provided guide questions were:

- What is the problem you are trying to solve?
- How can your insights drive business decisions?

And the outcome should involve a clear statement of the business task by identifing the business task and stakeholders.

### Prepare Phase
Some of the provided guide questions were:

- Where is your data located?
- How is it organized?
- Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? How does it help you answer your question?
- Are there any problems with the data?

What was required to do in this stage was to collect and safely store the data, evaluate it followed by sorting and filtering the data.

### Process Phase
This phase was guided by a Case Study Roadmap. It was asked to choose the tools needed in order to transform the data and document any cleaning or manipulation of the data.

### Analyze Phase
Some of the provided guide questions were:

- What trends or relationships did you find in the data?
- How will these insights help answer your business questions?
The tasks involved performing calculations such as averages (means), median, maximums and minimums. And comparing the service's user types behaviour while using the company's service.

### Share Phase
Following the mentioned Roadmap, visualizations were created in R cloud with the ggplot package, which supported the finding and conclusions arrived at the end stage of the project.

### Act phase
Some of the provided guide questions were:
- What is your final conclusion based on your analysis?
- How could your team and business apply your insights?
- What next steps would you or your stakeholders take based on your findings?
- Is there additional data you could use to expand on your findings?
A separe section in the report was dedicated to responding these questions.

## Reflections on the project

Throughout the course, the hands-on exercises provided a detailed approach regarding what to do and how to execute the assigned tasks. However, the current assignment presented a distinct and innovative proposal. While the steps were explicitly outlined, there was also ample opportunity to explore individual approaches towards accomplishing the assigned goal.

The decision to employ R as the analytical tool was rooted in its resemblance to a blank canvas, which allows for diverse coding paths to address a particular query. Moreover, generating graphs and tables and visualizing them on the same screen is straightforward with R.

Having completed the study case, my personal evaluation is that I have been introduced to the world of data analysis and acknowledge that there is still much to learn. While I recognize that I need to delve deeper into various platforms and languages, I am confident in my newly acquired communication and critical thinking skills, which enable me to assess business tasks efficiently.
